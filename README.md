# CodeCluster

##Purpose

We developers are proud of the code we wrote, but sometimes there are some code/function/method **CodeCluster** we wrote that can have multiple use cases over various different projects.

Therefore, comes in picture this repository where I've documented some of my **CodeClusters** that I think are really generic and  might be implemented over different projects.

Feel free to play and add your **CodeCluster** if you think they are generic enough or can have multiple use cases.
